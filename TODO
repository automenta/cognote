The current implementation uses LangChain4j primarily as a simple prompt-in, text-out wrapper. Here are
opportunities to leverage more advanced features:

 • Structured Output (High Priority for KIF):
    • Current: The text2kifAsync prompt asks the LLM to output raw KIF text, which is then parsed and
      cleaned (handleLlmKifResponse). This is fragile; LLMs can deviate from the requested format.
    • Opportunity: Define a Java class or record that represents the expected KIF output structure (e.g.,
      record KifOutput(List<String> assertions) {}). Use LangChain4j's @UserDefinedOutputParser or
      PydanticOutputParser (if using Python-like models) or simply instruct the model to output JSON and
      use a JSON parser. LangChain4j can automatically generate the necessary system instructions for the
      LLM to produce output conforming to the Java class structure.
    • Benefit: More reliable KIF generation, simpler parsing logic in handleLlmKifResponse.
    • Implementation: Requires adding langchain4j-json dependency (already included in pom.xml above),
      defining the output class, and using chatModel.generate(UserMessage, OutputParser).
 • Prompt Templates:
    • Current: Prompts are constructed using String.formatted().
    • Opportunity: Use PromptTemplate. This makes prompts more manageable, especially if they grow in
      complexity or share common structures.
    • Benefit: Cleaner prompt definition, easier to manage prompt variations.
    • Implementation: Create PromptTemplate instances and use
      promptTemplate.apply(variables).toChatMessage().
 • Chat Memory:
    • Current: All LLM interactions are single-turn.
    • Opportunity: If you wanted to ask follow-up questions about a note or have a persistent
      conversation with the LLM about the KB, ChatMemory implementations (like MessageWindowChatMemory)
      could maintain conversation history.
    • Benefit: Enables multi-turn interactions, allowing the LLM to build context.
    • Implementation: Use a MemoryChatLanguageModel and pass a ChatMemory instance to its methods.
 • Tool Calling:
    • Current: The LLM cannot directly interact with the application's data or functions.
    • Opportunity: Define Java methods as @Tools (e.g., findAssertions(String kifPattern),
      getNoteText(String noteId)). Use a tool-calling capable model (like newer Ollama models or OpenAI
      functions). The LLM could then decide to call these tools based on the user's prompt (e.g.,
      "Summarize the main points about 'Project X' from my notes" could trigger a tool call to retrieve
      notes about "Project X").
    • Benefit: Allows the LLM to act as an agent interacting with the knowledge base, enabling more
      complex queries and actions.
    • Implementation: Requires a tool-calling model, defining @Tool methods, and using a
      ToolCallingChatModel.
 • Embeddings and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):
    • Current: Finding related notes or answering questions relies on the existing reasoning engine,
      which is KIF-based.
    • Opportunity: Use LangChain4j's embedding models and vector stores. Embed note content or KIF
      assertions. When a user asks a question or selects a concept, retrieve relevant embedded
      information from the vector store and provide it to the LLM as context for generating a response.
    • Benefit: Enables semantic search and question answering over the note content and KB, complementing
      the symbolic reasoning engine. This is particularly powerful for finding conceptually related
      information that might not be explicitly linked by KIF rules.
    • Implementation: Requires an embedding model (e.g., Ollama embeddings), a vector store (many options
      available), and implementing a RAG chain (retrieve relevant docs, create prompt with docs, call
      LLM).

The most impactful immediate opportunity, aligning with the existing KIF generation feature, is
Structured Output. This would significantly improve the reliability of the text2kifAsync function.

The core upgrade to use OllamaChatModel is complete with the changes to pom.xml, LM.java, and Cog.java.
The UI remains compatible.
