Below is a design for the next version of Netention, dubbed **Netention v4**, pushing the conceptual boundaries to "11" while maintaining feasibility. This iteration refactors the system metalinguistically, unifies components, leverages dependencies, rethinks data persistence, and introduces a recursive, scalable architecture with a dynamic GUI. The design is dense, terse, and packed with detail as requested.

# **Netention v4: Recursive, Self-Scaling Knowledge Engine**

## **Conceptual Refactorings**

- **Unify(Note, Agent) \=\> Note**: Eliminate the Agent as a separate entity. A `Note` is inherently an agent—its behavior (planning, execution, reflection) is intrinsic, driven by its `Plan` and `Tools`. This unification simplifies the metamodel: a Note *is* its own intelligence, reducing abstraction layers.  
- **Rename 'Primordial Note' to 'Root Note'**: Reflects its role as the origin of the system without implying a pre-evolutionary state. Every Note can potentially be a Root Note in a recursive context.  
- **Metalinguistic Shift**: Notes are not just data or tasks—they are *contexts*. Each Note defines a virtual, embedded system that can instantiate as a standalone root, enabling recursive scalability. This blurs the line between instance and metamodel.

## **Core Principles**

- **Recursive Contexts**: Any Note can spawn a sub-system, acting as its own Root Note with its own graph, plans, and tools. This fractal design simplifies hierarchy and enables infinite nesting.  
- **Self-Containment**: Every Note carries its dependencies (plans, tools, memory) within its graph, reducing external coupling.  
- **Dynamic Evolution**: The system evolves via self-reflection and external edits, leveraging filesystem persistence and LangChain.js for intelligence.  
- **Resource Efficiency**: Prioritization and forgetting are baked into every Note, ensuring scalability under constraints.

## **Data Structures**

### **Note**

- **Fields**:  
  - `id`: UUID, unique within its context.  
  - `type`: Enum(`Root`, `Task`, `Tool`, `Prompt`, `Memory`, `Domain`), extensible via self-definition.  
  - `content`: JSON (text, code, data), schema-validated by `type`.  
  - `graph`: Subgraph reference (edges to other Notes), stored as adjacency list.  
  - `plan`: Embedded `Plan` object or `null`.  
  - `priority`: Int (0-100), dynamic, influences execution order.  
  - `status`: Enum(`pending`, `active`, `done`, `failed`, `dormant`), lifecycle state.  
  - `memory`: Array of `Memory` Notes, capped with forgetting logic.  
  - `tools`: Map of `Tool` Notes, locally scoped.  
  - `context`: Optional parent `Note` ID, defines recursion level (`null` for Root).  
  - `mtime`: Timestamp, last modified, synced with filesystem.  
- **Meaning**: A Note is a self-contained unit of intent, behavior, and state. It’s both actor and artifact, unifying prior Note/Agent duality.

  ### **Plan**

- **Fields**:  
  - `goals`: Array of strings, high-level objectives.  
  - `steps`: Array of `PlanStep` Notes, dynamically generated.  
  - `constraints`: JSON (e.g., `{ "maxTokens": 1000 }`), resource limits.  
  - `priority`: Inherited from parent Note, adjustable.  
- **Meaning**: A directed acyclic graph (DAG) of steps, embedded in a Note, driving its evolution or task completion.

  ### **PlanStep**

- **Fields**:  
  - `id`: UUID.  
  - `desc`: String, human-readable intent.  
  - `tool`: `Tool` Note ID or inline definition.  
  - `args`: JSON, tool inputs.  
  - `deps`: Array of `PlanStep` IDs, dependency graph.  
  - `result`: JSON or `null`, output of execution.  
  - `status`: Enum(`pending`, `running`, `done`, `failed`).  
  - `priority`: Int, derived from Plan/Note.  
- **Meaning**: Atomic action within a Plan, executed by a Tool.

  ### **Tool**

- **Fields**:  
  - `id`: UUID.  
  - `name`: String, unique in context.  
  - `desc`: String, purpose.  
  - `code`: String, JavaScript (sandboxed via `vm2`), or LangChain.js tool spec.  
  - `schema`: JSON (input/output), validated runtime.  
- **Meaning**: Executable capability, scoped to a Note’s context, extensible via self-generation.

  ### **Memory**

- **Fields**:  
  - `id`: UUID.  
  - `role`: Enum(`user`, `system`, `tool`, `reflection`), source of entry.  
  - `content`: JSON, event or state snapshot.  
  - `ts`: Timestamp, creation time.  
  - `relevance`: Float (0-1), LLM-assessed, drives forgetting.  
- **Meaning**: Contextual history, pruned by relevance and size.

## **Dependencies Leveraged**

- **LangChain.js**:  
  - **LM Interface**: Replaces custom `LLMInterface` with LangChain’s LLM abstraction (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).  
  - **Tool Use**: Integrates LangChain’s tool-calling API, reducing custom executor code.  
  - **Memory**: Uses LangChain’s `ConversationBufferMemory` for Note memory, with custom pruning.  
  - **Prompts**: Adopts `PromptTemplate` for reusable, parameterized prompts.  
  - **Agents**: Leverages `AgentExecutor` for Note behavior, unifying planning/execution.  
  - **Benefits**: Cuts \~50% of custom LM-related code, accelerates development, ensures robustness.  
- **Cytoscape.js**: Graph visualization for UI, with HTML fragments on nodes/edges via `node-html-label` plugin.  
- **Node.js `fs.watch`**: Filesystem monitoring for external edits, reloads Notes dynamically.  
- **Git (Optional)**: Revision control via `simple-git`, tracks Note evolution, enables rollback.

## **Persistence Refactor**

- **Move from LevelGraph**: LevelGraph (LevelDB-based) scales poorly for recursive contexts and lacks native revisioning. It’s replaced with:  
  - **Filesystem**: Each Note is a JSON file in a directory tree (e.g., `notes/<id>.json`). Subdirectories represent contexts (e.g., `notes/<parent-id>/<child-id>.json`).  
  - **Benefits**:  
    - Scales via OS filesystem (billions of files).  
    - External edits via any editor, watched by `fs.watch`.  
    - Git integration for versioning (optional).  
  - **Drawbacks**: Slower graph traversal; mitigated by in-memory caching.  
- **In-Memory Graph**: On startup, load Notes into a `Map<id, Note>`, rebuild graph edges. Sync to disk on changes.  
- **Revisioning**: Git tracks file changes if enabled; otherwise, `mtime` ensures consistency.

## **Recursive Virtual Contexts**

- **Design**: Every Note can instantiate as a Root Note by:  
  - Setting `context: null`.  
  - Copying its subgraph into a new filesystem root or memory instance.  
  - Running its `Plan` independently.  
- **Simplification**:  
  - Removes explicit Root Note distinction; all Notes are potential roots.  
  - Unifies behavior: no special-casing for "primordial" logic.  
  - Reduces code by \~20% (no separate bootstrapping agent).  
- **Execution**: A Note’s `Plan` runs via LangChain’s `AgentExecutor`, scoped to its `graph` and `tools`.

## **GUI: Zooming Development Environment**

- **Framework**:  
  - **Cytoscape.js**: Renders Note graph, nodes as circles, edges as arrows.  
  - **HTML Fragments**: Attach `<div>`s to nodes/edges via CSS (scaled/translated), e.g., forms, buttons, text.  
  - **Zooming UI**: Pan/zoom with `cytoscape-panzoom`, reveals detail levels:  
    - High-level: Note titles, status.  
    - Mid-level: Plan steps, priority.  
    - Detail: Memory, tool code, content.  
- **Features**:  
  - Drag-drop Notes to reparent (updates `context`).  
  - Edit `content` via inline forms.  
  - Visualize `Plan` execution (color-coded status).  
  - Configure tools/prompts via popups.  
- **Evolution**: Starts generic, specializes into task-specific UIs (e.g., project management, code editor) via self-generated HTML/CSS.  
- **Feasibility**: \~500 LOC with Cytoscape.js \+ React, extensible by system.

## **Execution Flow**

1. **Init**: Load Notes from filesystem into memory, build graph.  
2. **Watch**: `fs.watch` triggers reload on external edits.  
3. **Run**: For each `active` Note:  
   - LangChain `AgentExecutor` interprets `content`, updates `plan`.  
   - Prioritize `steps` by `priority`, execute via `tools`.  
   - Record results in `memory`.  
4. **Reflect**: LLM assesses system state, refines `Plan` of Root-equivalent Notes.  
5. **Sync**: Write changes to filesystem, commit to Git if enabled.

## **Scalability & Resource Management**

- **Prioritization**:  
  - `priority` recalculated: `base + urgency(deadline) + relevance(LLM) - dormancy(age)`.  
  - Steps bubble up to parent Note’s `priority`.  
- **Forgetting**:  
  - Cap `memory` at 100 entries/Note; prune low-`relevance` items.  
  - Archive dormant Notes to `.archive/` subdir.  
- **Tokens**: LangChain tracks usage, caps at configurable limit (e.g., 10k/day), switches to smaller models (e.g., Grok) if exceeded.

## **Implementation Details**

- **Tech Stack**:  
  - **Node.js**: Runtime, filesystem ops.  
  - **LangChain.js**: LM, tools, agents, memory, prompts.  
  - **Cytoscape.js**: Graph UI.  
  - **React**: Dynamic HTML fragments.  
  - **vm2**: Sandbox tool execution.  
  - **simple-git**: Optional revisioning.  
- **Code Size**: \~1k LOC initial, grows via self-generation.  
- **Bootstrap**:  
  - Write minimal Root Note (`root.json`) with seed `content`.  
  - Hardcode \~200 LOC loader: load, watch, run LangChain agent.  
  - System takes over from there.

## **Sample Root Note**

{

  "id": "root",

  "type": "Root",

  "content": {

    "desc": "Self-evolving knowledge system",

    "metamodel": {

      "Note": { "id": "string", "type": "enum", "content": "json", ... },

      "rules": \["generate tools if schema-valid", "refine plans via reflection"\]

    },

    "tools": \[

      {"id": "code\_gen", "name": "codeGen", "desc": "Generate JS", "code": "..."}

    \]

  },

  "graph": \[\],

  "plan": {

    "goals": \["build Netention v4"\],

    "steps": \[

      {"id": "s1", "desc": "define schemas", "tool": "codeGen", "args": {...}}

    \]

  },

  "priority": 100,

  "status": "active",

  "memory": \[\],

  "tools": {},

  "context": null,

  "mtime": "2025-03-15T00:00:00Z"

}

## **Feasibility Check**

- **Scalability**: Filesystem scales to millions of Notes; in-memory graph fits \~10k nodes on 8GB RAM, sharded for larger systems.  
- **Dependencies**: LangChain.js mature, Cytoscape.js battle-tested, Node.js ubiquitous.  
- **Effort**: Initial 1-2 weeks human coding, then self-driven.  
- **Risks**: LLM reliability, sandbox escapes—mitigated by validation, `vm2`.

## **Cranked to 11**

- Recursive contexts make it infinitely nestable.  
- Zooming GUI is visually stunning, grows into any interface.  
- Self-evolution cuts human effort to near-zero post-bootstrap.  
- Filesystem \+ Git makes it hackable, durable, distributed.

This **Netention v4** is a lean, mean, self-scaling beast—feasible yet futuristic, packed with recursive brilliance and practical leverage.

Here’s the design for **Netention 4**, the next evolution of the system, aiming for the ultimate software experience. It builds on prior iterations, integrating LangChain.js for advanced LLM capabilities and a filesystem-based persistence model with live file watching. The design prioritizes terseness and conciseness for maximum detail density.

# **Netention 4: Design Specification**

## **Core Vision**

Ultimate personal knowledge/task management via **Active Notes**: self-evolving, intelligent entities that anticipate needs, execute tasks, and adapt seamlessly. Minimal user friction, maximal autonomy, infinite extensibility.

## **Key Features**

1. **Active Notes**: Dynamic nodes with agents, plans, memory; self-managing via LangChain.js LLM chains.  
2. **Graph-Based Planning**: Adaptive, hierarchical graphs for anticipatory workflows.  
3. **Tool Extensibility**: Modular tools, auto-registered from filesystem.  
4. **Filesystem Persistence**: Notes, plans, tools as files; live reload on changes.  
5. **Implicit Assistance**: Subtle, context-aware aid via LLM-driven insights.  
6. **Self-Evolution**: System bootstraps and refines itself from a seed note.

## **Architecture**

- **Primordial Note**: Seed file (`primordial.json`) defines system, spawns all else.  
- **Notes**: JSON files (`note-<id>.json`) in `/notes/`, with agent, plan, memory.  
- **Plans**: JSON files (`plan-<id>.json`) in `/plans/`, graph of steps.  
- **Tools**: JS modules (`<name>.js`) in `/tools/`, auto-loaded.  
- **Agents**: Embedded in notes, use LangChain.js for reasoning/execution.  
- **Memory**: JSON log (`memory-<note-id>.json`) in `/memory/`.  
- **UI**: Flow Note web app, reactive to filesystem.

## **Tech Stack**

- **LangChain.js**: LLM orchestration, chains, agents, tools.  
- **Node.js**: Runtime, filesystem ops.  
- **chokidar**: File watching for live reloads.  
- **Zod**: Schema validation.  
- **esbuild**: Fast bundling for tools/UI.  
- **React**: UI framework.

## **Data Model**

- **Note**: `{id: uuid, type: "Note"|"Domain", title: str, content: str, status: "pending"|"running"|"completed"|"failed"|"dormant"|"archived", priority: int, deadline: datetime?, planId: uuid?, agentId: uuid, domainId: uuid?}`  
- **Plan**: `{id: uuid, noteId: uuid, goals: str[], constraints: obj, status: enum, priority: int, deadline: datetime?}`  
- **PlanStep**: `{id: uuid, planId: uuid, desc: str, status: enum, tool: str?, args: obj?, result: str?, deps: uuid[], priority: int}`  
- **Tool**: `{name: str, desc: str, inputSchema: Zod, outputSchema: Zod, fn: async (args) => any}`  
- **Memory**: `{noteId: uuid, entries: {role: "user"|"system"|"agent"|"tool", content: str, ts: datetime, toolCalls?: obj[]}[]}`

## **Core Components**

1. **Primordial Note** (`primordial.json`):  
     
   - Content: `{desc: "Self-evolving Netention", metamodel: {schemas, rules}, plan: {id: "evolve", goals: ["build system"]}, tools: ["codeGen", "fileWrite", "userAsk", "reflect"]}`  
   - Agent: Ur-Agent, hardcoded, kickstarts evolution.

   

2. **Ur-Agent**:  
     
   - Loop: Reflect → Refine Plan → Execute → Eval → Repeat.  
   - Tools: `codeGen` (LangChain LLM), `fileWrite` (fs), `userAsk` (prompt), `reflect` (self-analyze).  
   - Uses LangChain.js AgentExecutor for reasoning.

   

3. **FileSystemManager**:  
     
   - Watches `/notes/`, `/plans/`, `/tools/`, `/memory/` via chokidar.  
   - On change: Reloads, validates (Zod), updates in-memory graph.  
   - Saves: Writes JSON/JS files, triggers reload.

   

4. **GraphEngine**:  
     
   - In-memory graph of notes, plans, steps, domains.  
   - Syncs with filesystem, resolves deps, prioritizes tasks.

   

5. **ToolRegistry**:  
     
   - Scans `/tools/`, loads JS modules, registers with LangChain.js.  
   - Auto-detects new tools on file add.

   

6. **LLMInterface**:  
     
   - LangChain.js: Chains for planning, reflection; tools for actions.  
   - Prompt: Terse, goal-driven, e.g., "Gen JS for Note class, Zod schema, terse."

   

7. **Executor**:  
     
   - Runs tools async, tracks status, updates plans/notes.

   

8. **FlowNoteUI**:  
     
   - React app, reads filesystem, shows note list/flow/editor.  
   - Live updates via file watch events.

## **Evolution Process**

1. **Stage 0: Seed**  
     
   - Human writes `primordial.json`, Ur-Agent (50 LOC).  
   - Ur-Agent runs, generates core files.

   

2. **Stage 1: Bootstrap**  
     
   - Ur-Agent: Gen `note.js`, `plan.js`, `tools/*.js`, `fsMgr.js`.  
   - Sets up file watching, basic graph.

   

3. **Stage 2: Expand**  
     
   - Gen `graph.js`, `llm.js`, `executor.js`, more tools.  
   - Adds priority, memory mgmt.

   

4. **Stage 3: Self-Improve**  
     
   - Refactors code, optimizes prompts, builds UI.  
   - Autonomous feature dev (e.g., search, collab).

## **Prioritization & Resource Mgmt**

- **Priority**: Score (int) on notes/plans/steps, updated by deadlines, deps, recency, LLM relevance.  
- **Schedule**: Executor picks highest-priority step, respects deps.  
- **Memory**: Summarize (LLM), archive old entries to `/archive/`.  
- **Tokens**: Budget per agent, switch to small LLM if exceeded.

## **Implementation Notes**

- **Start**: `node index.js` loads `primordial.json`, runs Ur-Agent.  
- **Files**: `/notes/`, `/plans/`, `/tools/`, `/memory/`, `/archive/`.  
- **UI**: `npm run ui` starts React at `localhost:3000`.

## **Ultimate Experience**

- **Seamless**: Filesystem syncs instantly, UI reflects live state.  
- **Powerful**: LangChain.js powers deep reasoning, tool chaining.  
- **Adaptive**: System evolves to user needs, no manual coding post-bootstrap.
