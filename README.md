# Netention

Organize, prioritize, and grow thoughts into actionable results with real-time communication, matching, and analysis.

## Notes
- Thought Evolution: `Note`s describe thoughts and ideas, allowing them to evolve agentically.
- Shared Notes: Create, prioritize, and manage data collaboratively as `Note`s.
- Privacy by Default: All `Note`s are private unless explicitly shared.
- Persistent Queries: `Note`s represent enduring intent
- Semantic Matching: `Note`s capture meaning and intent semantically, enabling unambiguous and performant matching
- Notifications: The app receives responses to shared `Note`s
- Real vs. Imaginary: the matching of factual descriptions of real things to hypothetical (acceptable) descriptions of imaginary
  things - effecting the realization of imagination
- Describe things as they are (factual) or how you would like them to be (conditional)
- Tolerates vagueness and incomplete information 

## Components

### Core
- Prolog-like logic and reasoning for reasoning and planning
- Coordinates system proceses
- Manages prioritizable resources
- Manages notifications and events, used in implementing app features and interacting with users
- Develops and executes plans
- System activity guided by user's Note editing
- Websocket server

### TODO List (ui/note)
- Conventional "TODO List" editor
- Semantic Ontology: fields/forms/templates inserted by menu, or suggested
- WYSIWYG editor
- List: Sort, Search, Filter

### Mind Map (ui/mindmap)
- Free-form Note editor and organization tool
- Node/Edge Graph editing

### P2P Network
- Decentralized
- Networks:
    1. Nostr
    2. LibP2P
    3. etc...

### Community Simulator
- Narrates real-world simulated community interactions
- Semi-supervised tool for developing and optimizing the ontology (expressivitiy, descriptive ergonomics, metalinguistic abstraction, etc...), matching heuristics, and performance testing
- Sample randomly, with optional domain constraints: 
  - situations
  - intentions
  - description methods
  - etc...
- Identify missing bridging ontology or rules
- Identify user or multi-user patterns or workflows that can be managed or reinforced
